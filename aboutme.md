My name is Michael Kutka, and I currently work as the Manager of Network Services for a national IT Staffing Company in the Atlanta metropolitan area. I maintain a Network and VoIP infrastructure full of various Cisco devices as well as Windows and Linux-based servers and applications.

With a Bachelors of Information Technology degrees in the Networking and Security disciplines along with a couple of certifications i've picked up along the way, I have learned several decades' worth of knowledge through constant learning and training. I'm constantly striving to learn more in this field, and I enjoy being able to use that knowledge to help companies benefit from the different technologies available.
