My name is Michael Kutka, and I currently work as a Manager of Network Services for a national IT Staffing Company in the Atlanta metropolitan area. I maintain a Network and VoIP infrastructure full of various Windows and Linux-based servers and applications, including maintaining an IBM AS/400 ERP platform. 

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
